Use the node REPL to play with these types and their methods.

# function 
Read [function (from w3schools)](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp), [methods](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp), and [sort](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_sort.asp)  
Also: [function (from MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions)

## Become familiar with these features:   
- definition
- function arguments  
including default values, rest parameters
- return values
- arrow function syntax
- [scope](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_scope.asp)


## Don't worry about these features:
- generator functions
- arguments object  
We always declare our arguments.  But you may need to know this when reading 3rd party code.
- getters and setters


# statements 

## Become familiar with these features:   
- var, let, const
- [assignment](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_assignment.asp)

- [arithmetic and operator precedence](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arithmetic.asp)
- typeof, instanceof
- [if - else](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp)

Prefer using JS6 array iteration functions when appropriate.  
These include: forEach, map, every, find, etc.
- [while loop](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_while.asp)
