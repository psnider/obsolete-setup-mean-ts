# Heroku Cloud-based Servers
## Install
You must get a Heroku account from: [https://www.heroku.com/](https://www.heroku.com/)  
Then get the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.herokuapp.com/)  

We will not be using Heroku from our development environments, and instead will create environments specifically for deployment.

You must upload an SSH key to Heroku before you can push code to Heroku.
I had trouble with this. It didn't work until I did two things (not sure yet which matter):

- used a key without a password
- created a new key with the default name
- created a new key from an empty .shh directory
