Instructions for how to set up a MEAN (MongoDB / Express.js / Angular.js / Node.js) + Typescript development environment on Mac, with free software.

You should have OSX Mavericks (10.9) or later.  
If you don't find the answers you need in these instructions, you may [find additional help here](http://bit.ly/19Fksyd).

# Install Google Chrome Web Browser
**Dependencies**: No dependencies. You may set up Chrome whenever you like.
We use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/), because it:

- Uses the Javascript V8 VM (which is used by Node.js).
- Integrates well with Google tools.
- Has a powerful Javascript debugger.

## JSON Viewer

The [JSONView](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en) Chrome extension allows viewing of JSON files directly in Chrome.

Complete the installation:

- Visit [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
- Configure JSONView by checking **Allow access to file URLs**

Confirm the installation:  
Query the google maps servers for directions from Chicago to Los Angeles by clicking
[here](http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin=Chicago,IL&destination=Los+Angeles,CA&waypoints=Joplin,MO|Oklahoma+City,OK&sensor=false),
then you should see nicely structured JSON in your browser.
The document should highlight structure as you move your mouse,
and it should collapse sections when you click on minus signs,
and expand sections when you click on plus signs.
 

# Install an Editor
If you prefer, you can install [TextMate](TextMate-editor-install.md) instead.

## Install Atom Editor
**Dependencies**: No dependencies. You may set up Atom whenever you like.  
Download from [https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/)

### Configure to use Syntax highlighting for TypeScript

From within Atom, search for the atom-typescript add-on, and install it.

### Configure so tabs are set to 4 spaces for all text files.

In Settings, under Editor Settings, select "Soft Tabs" , and set "Tab Length" to 4.

### Configure so whitespace is standardized upon file save.

#### Strip trailing whitespace from all lines

v 0.129, and [atom/whitespace](https://github.com/atom/whitespace) v0.25, 
stripping trailing whitespace is a global setting.

Do not enable this, because it causes problems for MarkDown files.

#### Convert tabs to spaces upon file save.

This is done while editing, so no need for a separate command.

#### Exclude some directories from file search

This is not supported yet in Atom. See [find-and-replace/issues/149](https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/issues/149)

### Configure so files are saved upon losing window focus.

From the Settings (âŒ˜,), select Autosave, and check the "Enabled" box.

### Set a white cursor
Install the Atom package: [white-cursor](https://atom.io/packages/white-cursor)

### Enable previewing MarkDown files
Install the Atom package: [markdown-preview](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview)


<a name="GitHub App"></a> 
# Install GitHub App
**Dependencies**: You must have a GitHub account. There are no dependencies on any other tools. You may set up the GitHub app whenever you like.
Get GitHub app from: [http://mac.github.com/](http://mac.github.com/)  
You should also have SSH keys. You can set them up by following this article: [https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys)

- Download
- Move app to Application folder  
![should look like this](images/GitHub app in Applications.png)
- Follow instructions for configuration.



This should give you a functional GUI for managing your workspace with git.  
However, before you start using the workspace, you must finish the remaining configuration in these instructions.

# Install XCode and the Command Line Tools
**Dependencies**: XCode 5.0.2 requires OSX Mavericks/10.9.

You may set up Xcode whenever you like.
You can install XCode from the Apple App Store. Make sure get the correct version for your OSX version.  
We are using XCode 5.0.2 with OSX 10.9.

Once you have XCode installed, run it, and bring up the toolbar menu XCode -> Preferences,
and then on the Preferences panel, select the Downloads subpanel, click Components,
and install Command Line Tools. Or you can start the install from the command line:

```
xcode-select --install
```


# Install Node.js and Npm
**Dependencies**: No dependencies. You may set up Node.js and npm whenever you like.
Get Node.js v0.12.7 from [http://nodejs.org/download/](http://nodejs.org/download/), then find the button below on that page, and click it to download.  
![](images/Nodejs Download.png)  
This also installs npm v2.11.3, the node package manager.

### Configure so sudo isn't Required for Installs
Create a directory for globally installed npm packages, owned by your user, so that sudo isn't required:

```
sudo mkdir /usr/local/share/npm
sudo chown $USER /usr/local/share/npm
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/share/npm
````


Set the directory prefix for global packages:

```
echo prefix=/usr/local/share/npm >> ~/.npmrc
```

Add the following lines to your ~/.profile

```
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/share/npm/bin"' >>~/.profile
echo 'export NODE_PATH="/usr/local/share/npm/lib:./commonjs"' >>~/.profile
```

## Dependent Packages
We also need to install several support packages, globally, so they can be accessed from the command line, and by any project:

Note that npm has a bug around versions 1.4.14 in which it ignores the prefix setting in the ~/.npmrc file.
If this happens to you, a workaround is to specify the prefix directly on the command line as in:

```
npm install -g --prefix=$(npm config get prefix) typescript
```

- Typescript  
We'll use [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) whenever possible, because it adds strong typing to javascript.  
Use npm to install typescript:
```
npm install -g typescript
```
To update:  
```
npm cache clean
npm update -g typescript
```


- Typescript Declaration Files Manager
We'll use the [TypeScript Definition manager for DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/tsd) for managing TypeScript declaration files.  

Use npm to install tsd:
```
npm install tsd -g
```
To update:  
```
npm cache clean
npm update -g tsd
```

- Test Framework  
Let's use [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) because it is flexible,
and karma to connect to browsers for the client.  
Use npm to install both:

   ```
   npm install -g mocha karma karma-mocha karma-requirejs karma-chrome-launcher karma-firefox-launcher
   (cd /usr/local/share/npm/bin ; ln -s ../lib/node_modules/karma/bin/karma )
   ```
- Source Debugger  
We'll use [Node Inspector](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/blob/master/readme.md) for source level debugging of node programs, including mocha tests.  
Use npm to install node-inspector:

   ```
   npm install -g node-inspector
   ```


**NOTE: skip this for now, as we don't use the express command from the command line**

- Web Development Framework  
We'll use [express](https://npmjs.org/package/express), because it provides simple routing.

  ```
  npm install express
  ```

# Install Java
- The Java JDK download link. This was hard to find (the JRE link was easy). To find this link I had to search for the name of the download file, in this case it was jdk-7u55-macosx-x64.dmg
[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html](Oracle's download site)

Add these lines to your ~/.profile:

```
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_55.jdk/Contents/Home
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
```


# Install CLOC - Count Lines of Code

This counts lines of code, and has many options.

- [Documentation](http://cloc.sourceforge.net/)
- [Download](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cloc/files/latest/download?source=files)


#### Install

**Dependencies**: No dependencies. You may set up cloc whenever you like.

After downloading, copy it to the /usr/local/bin directory,
and create a shell function to run cloc with the correct arguments.
Make sure you change the CLOC_VER variable below to match the version of what you downloaded.

```
CLOC_VER=1.60
sudo cp /Users/$USER/Downloads/cloc-$CLOC_VER.pl /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cloc-$CLOC_VER.pl
cat - >> ~/.profile << END
function cloc()
{
    cloc-$CLOC_VER.pl --force-lang-def=$HOME/.cloc.lang_def \$*
}
END
source ~/.profile
```

Create ~/.cloc.lang_def, and set its contents to:

```
HTML
    filter remove_html_comments
    filter call_regexp_common HTML
    extension htm
    extension html
    3rd_gen_scale 1.90
Javascript
    filter remove_matches ^\s*//
    filter call_regexp_common C
    filter remove_inline //.*$
    extension js
    extension json
    3rd_gen_scale 1.48
    end_of_line_continuation \\$
Typescript
    filter remove_matches ^\s*//
    filter call_regexp_common C
    filter remove_inline //.*$
    extension ts
    3rd_gen_scale 1.48
    end_of_line_continuation \\$
```


### Examples
```
cloc schema src test  
cloc --exclude-lang=HTML,Javascript schema src test
```



# Install generateCodeVocabulary

#### Description

**generateCodeVocabulary** determines the symbols used in a collection of source files, and counts their use.  

It strips out all comments, integers, single-line strings, 
and single-line slash delimited regular expressions before collecting the vocabulary. 
This results in a vocabulary that contains all program symbols and keywords.

Warning: it does not work on files that have strings or regular expressions that span multiple lines.

This has been tested with TypeScript/Javascript, but should work for any language that has a CLOC configuration, and that has C-style strings, and slash delimited regular expressions. 

By keeping the generated vocabulary files for each version of code, changes can be verified before submitting code to your version control system.


#### Install

**Dependencies**: This uses CLOC.


This utility is part of this **setup-mean-ts** repo.
Copy the files to /usr/local/bin:

```
chmod +x generateCodeVocabulary.py
sudo cp generateCodeVocabulary.* /usr/local/bin
```

#### Examples
These commands are run as part of our **reports** target of make:

```
    generateCodeVocabulary.py --ext ts --out reports/client.vocabulary.json src/client
    generateCodeVocabulary.py --ext ts --out reports/server.vocabulary.json src/server
    generateCodeVocabulary.py --ext ts --out reports/test.vocabulary.json test
    -rm reports/all.vocabulary.json
    generateCodeVocabulary.py --ext vocabulary.json --out reports/all.vocabulary.json reports
```
